# TCS Stock Price Prediction ðŸ“Š

This project is a comprehensive tool for predicting the stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) using various machine learning models. The application is built using Streamlit and includes several models like LSTM, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression.

## Features

- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Automatically fetches TCS stock data from Yahoo Finance for the period from 2013 to 2023.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts for visualizing stock prices, including closing prices and moving averages.
- **Model Training & Prediction**: Multiple models are used to predict stock prices, providing a comparison of performance metrics.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays RÂ² and RMSE for regression models, and accuracy and confusion matrices for the logistic regression model.

## Models Implemented

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
2. **Linear Regression**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
5. **Support Vector Regression**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**
7. **Logistic Regression**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mbalajiviswanadh/Stock-Price-Prediction
   cd tcs-stock-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open the application in your browser and select "TCS" from the dropdown to start the analysis.

## Data Visualization

- **Closing Price vs Time**: Displays the closing price over time.
- **Moving Averages**: Includes 100-day and 200-day moving averages for better trend analysis.
